# Route Cipher Encryption and Decryption

This C++ program implements the Route Cipher algorithm for both encryption and decryption of messages. The Route Cipher is a transposition cipher that rearranges the characters of a message based on a secret key.

## Overview

The program includes functions for string-to-char conversion, encryption, decryption, and matrix filling. The encryption process involves arranging the letters of the message in a matrix in a clockwise pattern, while the decryption process reverses this pattern to reveal the original message.

## Usage

1. Run the program and choose between Route Cipher Encryption (Option A) or Route Cipher Decryption (Option B).
2. Enter the secret key that will be used
